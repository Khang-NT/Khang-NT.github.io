We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful.

When you’re not signed in to YMusic using your Youtube Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the application, or device you’re using. This helps us do things like maintain your language preferences across sessions.

When you’re signed in YMusic using Youtube account, we also collect certain information attached to your Youtube account. We collect your email address, your name, and your profile picture, in addition to basic information like location and language collected irrespective of signing in.

All the personal sensitive information like email address are stored in their encrypted/hashed forms on our servers.

The following table explains the information collected by YMusic on its servers:
